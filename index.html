          Machine Learning can be defined as the ability of a machine to learn 
          something without having to be programmed for that specific thing.<br >
          It is the field of study where computers use a massive set of data 
          and apply algorithms for â€˜trainingâ€™ themselves and making predictions.
      
        </p>
        <p>
          In this blog, you will know everything about Machine Learnig. We will learn Machine learning 
          and it different types.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Machine learning is a branch of <mark>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</mark>  
          and computer science which focuses on the use of data and 
          algorithms to a imitate<br> the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
          Machine Learning has paved way into various business industries across the world.<br>
          <br>
          It is all because of the incredible ability of Machine Learning to drive 
          organizational growth, automate manual and mundane jobs, enrich the customer <br> experience, and meet business goals.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, Machine Learning Engineer is the fourth-fastest growing job as per LinkedIn.<br>
          Both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are going to be imperative to the forthcoming society.Hence, this is the right time to learn Machine Learning.

        </p>
        <h3>How does Machine Learning work?</h3>
        <p>
          Machine learning works on different types of algorithms and techniques. 
          These algorithms are created with the help of various ML programming languages.<br>
          Usually, a training dataset is fed to the algorithm to create a model.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now, whenever input is provided to the ML algorithm, 
          it returns a result value/predictions based on the model. 
          Now, if the prediction is accurate, <br>it is accepted and the algorithm is deployed. 
          But if the prediction is not accurate, the algorithm is trained 
          repeatedly with a training dataset to arrive <br>at an accurate prediction/result.
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>Consider this example:</em><br>
          <br>If you wish to predict the weather patterns in a particular area, 
          you can feed the past weather trends and patterns to the model through the 
          algorithm.<br>This will be the training dataset for the algorithm.
          Now if the model understands perfectly, the result will be accurate.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the different types of Machine Learning?</h3>
        <p>Machine Learning algorithms run on various programming languages and techniques.
           However, these algorithms are trained using various methods.<br>
           Out of which three main types of Machine learning are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Supervised Learning</li>
          <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
          <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now we will see this all one by one.</p>

        <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
          <p>Supervised Learning is the most basic type of Machine Learning, 
          where labeled data is used for training the machine learning algorithms.<br>
          A dataset is given to the ML model for understanding and solving the problem.
          This dataset is a smaller version of a larger<br> dataset and conveys 
          the basic idea of the problem to the machine learning algorithm.
          </p>

        <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Unsupervised Learning is the type of Machine Learning where no human 
          intervention is required to make the data machine-readable and
          train<br> the algorithm.
          Also, contrary to supervised learning, unlabeled
            data is used in the case of unsupervised learning.
            <br>
          Since there is no human intervention and unlabeled a data is used, the 
          algorithm can work on a larger data set. Unlike supervised learning<br>and 
          unsupervised learning does not require labels to establish relationships 
          between two data points.
        </p>
        <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Reinforcement Learning is the type of Machine Learning where the algorithm 
          works upon itself and learns from new situations by using<br>a trial-and-error
          method. Whether the output is favorable or not is decided based on the 
          output result already fed to each iteration.
        </p>
        
      <h3>Applications of Machine Learning</h3>

            <li>Image Recognition</li>
          <li>Speech Recognition</li>
          <li>Product recommendations</li>
          <li>Email Spam and Malware Filtering</li>
